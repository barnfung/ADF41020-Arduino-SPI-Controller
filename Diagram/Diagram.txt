Here is what you need to run this system:

15V Power Supply
- Connect 15VGND to the GND peg on the ADF chip (in the picture in this directory, that is the far left)
- Connect 15VPWR to the Red peg in the middle of the ADF chip (in thie picture, that is 2nd to the left)

5V Power Supply
- Plut 5VGND and 5VPWR into the plugs on the board.

Desolder:
- Resistors leading to the holes for SCK, LE, and DATA
- Connect MOSI from Arduino to resistor divider / level shifter then to DATA on Board
- Connect SCK from Arduino to resistor divider / level shifter then to CLK on Board
- Connect LE from Arduino to resistor divider / level shifter then to LE on Board

I used a shield for the Uno for all the resistor dividers / soldering.

GND
- You must hook up GND on the Arduino to GND on the ADF board. I ran GND to the anode of the big diode on the ADF board right next to the power switch and just soldered it on.
